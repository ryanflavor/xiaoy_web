## 🚀 Story 1.1 Readiness

**Can Story 1.1 Begin?** ✅ **YES, with risk mitigation**

### Ready Components:
- ✅ Frontend infrastructure with all required libraries
- ✅ API Gateway with instruction endpoints
- ✅ WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- ✅ State management for instruction handling
- ✅ Mock backend services for development

### Risk Areas:
- ⚠️ No automated testing framework
- ⚠️ No CI/CD pipeline
- ⚠️ Instruction parser logic not implemented
- ⚠️ Development documentation incomplete

### Mitigation Strategy:
1. Implement instruction parser as first Story 1.1 task
2. Use manual testing until framework ready
3. Rely on pre-commit hooks for quality
4. Document setup as work progresses

## 📋 Implementation Guide

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repo>
cd xiaoy_web
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# The following will start:
# - API Gateway: http://localhost:3001
# - Web Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Mock ZMQ Broker (automatic)
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# API Gateway (.env)
USE_MOCK_ZMQ=true
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=development-secret

# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
```

### Testing the Stack
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Login (mock auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "trader1", "password": "password123"}'

# Parse instruction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/instructions/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"text": "双卖 500 当月 万1 的v", "accounts": ["account1"]}'
```
