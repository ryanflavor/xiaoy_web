## Problem Statement

Based on comprehensive PO Master Checklist and Architect Checklist validations, the project has excellent architecture design (88% ready) but lacks foundational infrastructure to begin development. Critical blockers prevent Story 1.1 from proceeding to approved status.

## Critical Blockers Identified

### 🔴 **Infrastructure Blockers (8 items)**
1. **No Project Structure** - Missing `apps/api-gateway/` directory and scaffolding
2. **No Development Environment** - Missing `package.json`, dependencies, build configuration  
3. **No Access to Existing System** - Cannot verify ZMQ broker or authentication integration
4. **Missing Infrastructure Setup** - No API framework, database connections configured
5. **No CI/CD Pipeline** - Missing automated build, test, deployment processes
6. **No Environment Configuration** - Missing dev/staging/prod environment setup
7. **No Dependency Management** - Missing package management and version control
8. **No Development Tooling** - Missing linting, formatting, testing framework setup
